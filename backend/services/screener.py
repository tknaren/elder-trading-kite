"""
Elder Trading System - Screener Service
Implements the Triple Screen methodology for stock screening

NOTE: This module now uses the enhanced v2 functions with all validation fixes.

Features v2:
- Screen 1 as MANDATORY GATE (not just scoring)
- Impulse RED blocks trades entirely
- Correct daily_ready logic (AND/OR)
- New high-scoring rules (divergence, false breakout, kangaroo tail)
- Elder Entry/Stop/Target calculations

VALIDATION FIXES APPLIED:
1. Screen 1 must pass before any scoring occurs
2. Impulse RED disqualifies trade (not just penalty)
3. daily_ready = screen1_passed AND impulse_ok AND (force_index < 0 OR stochastic < 30)
4. is_a_trade includes weekly_bullish check
5. Stochastic oversold threshold: 30 (was 50)

NEW HIGH-SCORING RULES:
+3: MACD divergence (strongest signal per Elder)
+3: Price near lower channel (short-term oversold)
+3: False downside breakout
+3: Pullback to value (Weekly EMA↑, Daily EMA↑, price < fast EMA)
+2: Kangaroo tail pattern
+2: Force Index down spike

ENTRY/STOP/TARGET (Elder Method):
- Entry: Daily EMA-22 (buy at value)
- Target: Keltner Channel Upper Band
- Stop: Below deepest historical EMA-22 penetration
